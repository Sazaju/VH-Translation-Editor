PURPOSE

This project aims at building some translation tools to help VH translators.

HOW TO

Once you have downloaded this project, you can build a JAR and use it as
a library or run the Main.main() or the JUnit tests XxxTest. To execute
the main/tests, you need to put the SVN repo of VH Translation in the
same folder than the executable (or simply as a folder in the Eclipse
project directly) and name it "VH". If it is not clear, look at the code
and guess ;)

ISSUES

If you have any problem, open an issue on the GitHub repo of this project.
